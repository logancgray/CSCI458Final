Logan Gray and Keyes Dorsey

Meeting 1: Introduction to Git and Creation of Table Schema

General Purpose:
This app is meant to be a kind of all-covering mobile app for World of Warcraft, from this point simply called
WoW. This app is meant to be a companion app of sorts for both beginners and experienced players alike. I 
believe this will be best served as a mobile app due to almost everyone these days has a smart phone, but not
everyone is able to run a dual-screen setup. Having all of this information on the players phone allows for
the information to be accessed while being in-game for the general populace.It will contain crucial 
information that will help new players grow into the game easier and faster. Likewise, it is also meant to 
serve as a way for more experienced players to possibly learn new things about the game,whether it be just a 
simple guide on how to get a new mount or a guide for creating a new character they havenever played before.
